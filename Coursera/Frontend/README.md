# HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers | John Hopkins

[Link to Coursera Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers)

I audited this course and the content is freely available through coursera and the related GitHub Repos.

The flow of the notes.md will be chronological in this order.

1. [HTML](./HTML/README.md)
2. [CSS](./CSS/README.md)
3. [Javascript](./Javascript/README.md)

Due to the nature of HTML, CSS and Javascript building on top off of each other.
I recommend following along in this order.

TODO I need to add all of the relevant links and pages to this page.

TODO If I add in any of these notes to github I will need to update this TODO as well as provide links to each portion of notes by chapter on this page.
