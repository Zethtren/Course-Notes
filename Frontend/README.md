# HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers | John Hopkins

[Link to Coursera Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers)

I audited this course and the content is freely available through coursera and the related GitHub Repos.

TODO I need to add all of the relevant links and pages to this page.
TODO If I add in any of these notes to github I will need to update this TODO as well as provide links to each portion of notes by chapter on this page.
