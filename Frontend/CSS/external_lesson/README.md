# Bootstrap CSS Framework - Full Course for Beginners

[Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qfEOE4vtxE)

I am taking a detour from the course work for the chapter titled "Twitter
Bootstrap". Any content from this chapter will use a more up-to-date resource.
The notes will continue from the main notes.md and resources will be saved and
linked to the contents of this folder. This segment (Unless something else
comes up during the development of this segment) will be the last contents of
the CSS notes page. Afterwards we will move onto the contents for the Static
webpage exercise and then Javascript.
